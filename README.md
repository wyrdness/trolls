## Overview

Trolls are creatures from Scandinavian folklore, deeply embedded in the cultural traditions of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland. Typically depicted as large, grotesque humanoids, trolls dwell in mountains, caves, and remote forests, away from human settlements.

One of their most distinctive characteristics is their vulnerability to **sunlight**, which turns them to **stone**. This trait has been used to explain unusual rock formations throughout Scandinavia. Trolls are often portrayed as hostile to humans—sometimes stealing children or livestock—but are also depicted as slow-witted and easily tricked by clever protagonists.

**Regional Variations**:
- **Norwegian**: Enormous mountain-dwelling giants
- **Danish/Swedish**: Smaller forest and cave trolls with magical qualities
- **Icelandic**: Similar to elves or hidden people (*huldufólk*)

In modern times, trolls have evolved from fearsome folklore figures into beloved symbols of Nordic heritage, appearing in children's stories, tourism, and popular culture worldwide.

## ⚠️ Cultural Sensitivity Note

- Predates Christianity by centuries
- Represents deep connection to Scandinavian landscape
- Remains part of living cultural identity
- Should be distinguished from modern commercialized versions

Please approach troll folklore with respect for its cultural significance.
