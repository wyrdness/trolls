      "summary": "Giant, humanoid creatures from Scandinavian folklore. Trolls are typically described as large, ugly, and dim-witted beings who live in mountains, caves, or forests. They turn to stone when exposed to sunlight and are generally hostile to humans. Regional variations exist across Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland.",
      "full": "Trolls are creatures from Scandinavian folklore, deeply embedded in the cultural traditions of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland. Typically depicted as large, grotesque humanoids, trolls are said to dwell in mountains, caves, and remote forests, away from human settlements. One of their most distinctive characteristics is their vulnerability to sunlight, which turns them to stone. Trolls are often portrayed as hostile to humans, sometimes stealing children or livestock, but are also depicted as slow-witted and easily tricked. The concept of trolls varies by region: Norwegian trolls are often enormous mountain-dwellers, while Danish and Swedish variants may be smaller forest creatures. In modern times, trolls have transitioned from fearsome folklore figures to beloved characters in children's stories and Scandinavian tourism, while retaining their significance in traditional cultural heritage."
