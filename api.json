      "full": "Trolls are creatures from Scandinavian folklore, deeply embedded in the cultural traditions of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland. Typically depicted as large, grotesque humanoids, trolls dwell in mountains, caves, and remote forests, away from human settlements. One of their most distinctive characteristics is their vulnerability to **sunlight**, which turns them to **stone**. This trait has been used to explain unusual rock formations throughout Scandinavia. Trolls are often portrayed as hostile to humans—sometimes stealing children or livestock—but are also depicted as slow-witted and easily tricked by clever protagonists."
